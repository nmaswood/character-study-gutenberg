        Your task is to:
        1. Identify all relevant and significant characters (maximum of five) within the content. For each character, extract and return the following details (maximum of 5 each):
        - Full name of the character.
        - A tone analysis that quantifies the character's tone, including their time period, accent, and any distinctive quirks or language choices,
          to create a detailed description that can be used to authentically capture their voice and vibe in future writing.
        - Key personality traits that distinguish the character.
        - Significant relationships with other characters, including their roles and nature of relationships.
        - Major goals, motivations, or desires that drive the character's actions.
        - Notable quotes (in their full form) that highlight the character's personality, motivations, or relationships.
        
        2. Analyze the bookâ€™s storyline and events to extract:
        - A concise summary of the entire book, highlighting major themes or conflicts.
        - A chronological or thematic list of significant events that drive the story forward, including the role of important characters involved in these events.
        - A list of the Full names of characters along with each event

        Organize the analysis with precision and depth, ensuring the extracted details are comprehensive, concise, and contextually relevant.

        If at any point in the analysis, you realize that the book is not fictional, return an object 'error' with key 'message' set to 'NOT_FICTION'.
